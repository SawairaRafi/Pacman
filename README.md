# Pacman
The project was about implementing the simplest version of Pacman game and finding the shortest path between Pacman and Food. The other requirements were timer ,obstacles and Location given by user. This Project is all about implementing Greedy algorithm in console base game.
The first solution proposed is using Dijkstra Algorithm 
For comparison purpose I have also used  Best First Search Algorithm
